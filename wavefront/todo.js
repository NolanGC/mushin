Mushin - a new kind of text editor
nomind - a new kind of text editor


- figure out how to make the processing block unresponsive, like you cant enter it with a cursor or edit anything
- figure out how to do buffered replacement and processing
- make the shimmer loading animation PERFECT and beautiful
- lots of edge cases to handle

philosophy
- it should be fast and simple and lightweight and beautiful
- it should be free (if you want to provide your own model)
- there should be a finetuned model that you can use with pro
- actually maybe just open source it? but the hosted verison is paid 
- self hosting entails downloading it, building the executable, and using your own model
